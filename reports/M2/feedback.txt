- I am not fully convinced that RNN will fit poorly for your model. Actually RNN is good for sequence modeling beyond text. The chance of wild fire happening is centainly related to weather condition at previous timestamps. So I feel like your project certainly have sequence modeling component where RNN might help. To me, they are better fit than multiple regression models, and using an appropriate model certainly helps reducing the loss
